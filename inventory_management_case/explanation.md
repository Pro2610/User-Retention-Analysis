# ðŸ“– Explanation: Inventory Logic

This case focuses on identifying stock risks and summarizing inventory performance.

---

âœ… `stock_level < reorder_point`  
â†’ Products that may soon run out.

âœ… `stock_level = 0`  
â†’ Out of stock â€” urgent attention.

âœ… `AVG(stock_level)` by category  
â†’ Helps detect which categories are understocked on average.

You can extend this with `CASE` logic to create custom status labels.
